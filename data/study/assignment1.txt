Assignment 1: Python File Operations

Objective:
Practice safe and idiomatic file handling in Python.

Tasks:
1. Create a text file containing a list of tasks
2. Read the file line by line
3. Append additional tasks without overwriting existing data
4. Convert the text file into CSV format
5. Create a backup copy of the original file

Constraints:
- Use pathlib for all file paths
- Handle missing files gracefully
- Write reusable, testable functions

Deliverables:
- Python script implementing the tasks
- Unit tests validating correct behavior
